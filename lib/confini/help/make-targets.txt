GNU make utility to maintain libconfini 1.16.0

Commonly used targets:

  make,
  make all                compile the library
  make help               print this help page
  make install,
  make install-strip      install the library - if `make (all)` has not been
                          launched yet, it will be launched first
  make uninstall          delete all the files created by `make install(-*)`
  make check,
  make installcheck,
  make finishcheck        check that the compiled library is in good
                          conditions; in particular, `make check` tests the
                          compiled objects directly from the source directory,
                          `make installcheck` tests the compiled objects from
                          the installation paths (you can pass a `DESTDIR`
                          variable in case of staged installations), and `make
                          finishcheck` tests the compiled objects from the
                          installation paths without passing any information
                          to the compiler about the latter, in order to check
                          that <includedir> and <libdir> are automatically
                          reachable (therefore no `DESTDIR` variable is
                          supported here); note that `make installcheck` and
                          `make finishcheck` can be launched only after having
                          launched `make install(*)`
  make mostlyclean,
  make clean,
  make distclean          clean the source directory according to different
                          degrees of fury
  make clobber            launch `make uninstall` followed by `make clean`
  make alldone            launch `make install-strip` followed by `make
                          installcheck` - in case of staged installations it
                          is possible to pass a `DESTDIR` variable (see below)
  make binary-release,
  make manifest           create respectively a package and a manifest in the
                          current location containing all the files that would
                          be installed by `make install-strip` - if `make
                          (all)` has not been launched yet, it will be
                          launched first
  make portable-builds    create a package containing all the files that would
                          be installed by `make install-exec-strip`, but
                          without any directory structure - if `make (all)`
                          has not been launched yet, it will be launched first
  make git-clone          download the latest revision of libconfini from the
                          server (the `git` utility is required); note that
                          the downloaded archive might be a work in progress
                          and not an official release yet

Package maintenance targets:

  make dist(-*),
  make source-release,
  make authors-copy       create a re-distributable copy of this package,
                          ignoring any local configuration; the `make dist(*)`
                          targets are GNU Automake's built-in recipes for
                          redistributing the source code of a generic package,
                          while the last two targets have been written with
                          this package in mind (but they all do their job
                          well); in particular, `make source-release` is
                          similar to `make dist`, with the difference that it
                          tries to reproduce the shape of the package as close
                          as possible to the original release; same goes for
                          `make authors-copy`, although this goes a step
                          further and re-creates the original package as after
                          launching `make bootstrap-clean`
  make maintainer-clean,
  make bootstrap-clean,
  make oblivion-clean     clean the source directory according to different
                          degrees of fury beyond `make distclean` - unless you
                          are a package maintainer you should not use these
                          targets, as your machine might not have the tools
                          for re-creating the files deleted by `make
                          maintainer-clean`, `make bootstrap-clean` and `make
                          oblivion-clean`
  make distcheck          create a redistributable package and check that
                          everything in it works as it is supposed to work
  make snapshot           create a clean backup of everything, including
                          non-distributable files, but without the files
                          generated by GNU Autotools

Package development targets:

  make mergenew           merge all the files created by the `configure`
                          option `--enable-extended-config=sandbox`
  make all-baremetal-sources,
  make baremetal-source-code,
  make baremetal-symbols,
  make all-official-sources,
  make official-source-code,
  make official-symbols,
  make all-sources        (Re-)generate the source code of libconfini using
                          the content of the `dev` subdirectory these targets
                          are available only after passing the
                          `--enable-author-mode` option to the `configure`
                          script

Special targets:

  make all-baremetal-sources,
  make baremetal-source-code,
  make baremetal-symbols  Generate the "bare metal" source code of libconfini
                          - these targets are available only after passing the
                          `--without-io-api` option to the `configure` script
  make approve-revision,
  make reject-revision    Approve/reject the current customization for a
                          non-standard environment (available only in specific
                          cases)
  make refresh            (Re)build all the targets listed in the `EXPIRE`
                          user variable, as in `make
                          EXPIRE='libconfini-git.tar.gz
                          libconfini-snapshot.tar.gz' refresh`

Optional variables:

  CC,
  CFLAGS,
  LDFLAGS,
  etc.                    Supported by `make (all)`, these variables allow to
                          change on the fly the setup used to build single
                          targets or the entire package, even when they have
                          already been specified with different values to the
                          `configure` script; type `./configure --help` for
                          more information about these variables
  DESTDIR                 Supported by the `make install(-*)` and `make
                          uninstall(-*)` targets, the `DESTDIR` variable
                          allows to change the final installation path,
                          independently of how the package has been
                          configured; this variable can contain absolute paths
                          only and defaults to an empty string when omitted;
                          the `DESTDIR` variable is meant to be used only in
                          case of staged installations and should never
                          contain a real installation path - if you need to
                          customize the target directories, launch
                          `./configure --help`
  ZIPTYPE                 Supported by `make authors-copy`, `make
                          binary-release`, `make git-clone`, `make
                          portable-builds`, `make source-release` and `make
                          snapshot`, this variable allows to change the
                          compression format of the archives created; possible
                          values are: `tar.gz`, `tar.xz`, `tgz`, `txz`, `zip`
  DEST                    Supported by `make authors-copy`, `make
                          binary-release`, `make git-clone`, `make manifest`,
                          `make portable-builds` and `make source-release`,
                          the `DEST` variable allows to change the destination
                          and possibly the compression format of the archives
                          created (in the last case with the exception of
                          `make manifest`, as this never produces archives);
                          for example: `make DEST='libconfini-edited.zip'
                          portable-builds` creates a zip archive named
                          `libconfini-edited` instead of the default `.tar.gz`
                          archive; if no recognizable extension is present, a
                          directory will be created instead; archive formats
                          supported are: `tar.gz`, `tar.xz`, `tgz`, `txz`,
                          `zip`; this variable always overrides `ZIPTYPE`
  DISTFLAGS               Supported by `make source-release` and `make
                          authors-copy`, the `DISTFLAGS` variable can contain
                          a space-separated list of options for the generated
                          package. The only flag currently supported is
                          `no-symlinks`, which can be used for replacing all
                          the symbolic links present in the package with hard
                          copies
  EXPIRE                  A space-separated list of targets to build even when
                          up-to-date
