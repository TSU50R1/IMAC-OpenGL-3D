Hi		=	there!
This		=	"is a quoted value"
"And this"	=	is a quoted key

# You don't really need to use quotes unless you want a special character not to be parsed
Like this character: "=", which		=	...as you see has not been parsed!

; you can remove quotes using the functions `ini_string_parse()` and `ini_unquote()`
password	=	"hello world"

;    comments are dispatched verbatim, without removing their leading and trailing spaces

###### the following is a section:
[section]
foo = bar

############# the following is a subsection
[section.subsection]
Hi again = there!		# this is an inline comment

# and the following is another way of appending a subsection
[.subsubsection]
some = value

# the following is an unknown element
=hi!

# and the following is another unknown element
[hello

# By default libconfini does not dispatch other types of unknown elements other than the previous two cases; unknown elements are left unformatted

; the following is an empty key
empty_key =

; the following is an implicit key
implicit

[section."the.dot.characters.between.quotes.will.not.be.parsed..."]
multi-line	=	this is\
			a multi-line value!

[this   . \
	is \
	. a . \
		multi-line. \
					section \
	.name \
]

and \
this \
		is \
a \
	multi-line \
key = hi!

# the following is a disabled key:
#hello=world

#and_this=is \
		#a \
	#multi-line \
#disabled entry

# the following is a disabled section
#[disabled_section]
#disabled_key = belongs to [disabled_section]

the first active key after a disabled section = is obviously appendend to the last active section

## for more info, please type `man libconfini`
